# Pathing algorithm
- Improved
- variable
   - shortest distance
   - shortest time
   - number of rotations
       - Less energy efficient
       - more time consuming
   - shortest energy

## To do
Python
- function(number of verticies of map, number of holes) - generate map -> 2d array, edges, hole1, holek
- function([outside points[]], [hole points[[]]], robot width) - CCPP -> 2d array of points
    - 2d array of outside points
    - look at paper Edwin sent to teams for open source path algorithm

- K angle shape algorithm
Starting to move, find ideal path, robot is somewhere on that path, go from there - still optimal


Look at making a server
- AWS
    - EC2










# wheel encoder odometry
- Talk to RTK Tower
- doesnt account for altitude change
